	  <t>
The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL, RFC 6550) enables data packet
routing along a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph . However,
the default route establishment mechanism relies on hop-by-hop forwarding along
the DODAG, which may not always provide optimal routing efficiency. This
document introduces the concept of DAO Projection, a mechanism that allows a
RPL root or an external controller to install optimized routes within the RPL
domain. DAO Projections enable the creation of optimized unicast or multicast
routes that do not strictly follow the DODAG structure, thereby improving
routing efficiency, reliability, availability, and resource utilization in the RPL
domain. The document specifies two types of projected routes—storing mode and
non-storing mode projections—and outlines the signaling procedures necessary to
establish, maintain, and remove these routes. 
   This document extends RFC 6550, RFC 6553, and RFC 8138.

	<section anchor='introduction'><name>Introduction</name>

	   <t> RPL, the <xref target='RFC6550'>
   "Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks"</xref> (LLNs),
   is a Distance Vector protocol, which is well-suited
   for application in a variety of low energy Internet of Things (IoT)
   networks where constrained nodes cannot maintain the full view of the 
   topology, and stretched P2P paths are acceptable vs. the signaling
   and state overhead involved in maintaining the shortest paths across.
   Additionally, RPL is anisotropic, meaning that its operation 
   depends on the orientation of the links, down from or up towards the 
   Root, with the default route advertised down and more specific paths
   advertised up along a limited set of links.
    </t>
<t>
   RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) in which
   the Root often acts as the Border router to connect the RPL domain to the
   IP backbone. Routers inside the DODAG route along that graph up towards
   the Root for the default route and down towards destinations in the RPL
   domain for more specific routes.
   This specification expects as a pre-requisite a pre-existing RPL Instance
   with an associated DODAG and RPL Root, which are referred to as main Instance,
   main DODAG and main Root respectively. The main Instance is operated in RPL
   Non-Storing Mode of Operation (MOP).
    </t>
<t>
   With this specification, an abstract routing function called a Path
   Computation Element (PCE) (e.g., located in a central
   controller or collocated with the main Root) interacts with the main Root to
   compute additional paths betwwen nodes in the main Instance. In Non-Storing
   Mode, the base topological information to be passed to the PCE, that is the
   knowledge of the main DODAG, is already available at the Root.
   This specification introduces protocol extensions that enrich the topological
   information available to the Root with sibling relationships that are usable
   but not leveraged to form the main DODAG.
    </t>
<t>
   Based on usage, path length, and knowledge of available resources such as
   battery levels and reservable buffers in the nodes, the PCE with a global
   visibility of the system can optimize the computed routes for the
   application needs, including the capability to provide path redundancy.
   This specification also introduces protocol extensions that enable the
   Root to project (i.e., advertise from a remote location) the computed 
   paths in the RPL domain as
   Projected Routes (a.k.a. P-Routes) on behalf of the PCE.
    </t>
       <t>
    A P-Route may be installed in either Storing or Non-Storing Mode,
    potentially resulting in hybrid situations where the Mode in which 
    the P-Route operates is different from that of the RPL main Instance.

    P-Routes can be used as stand-alone segments meant to reduce the size of the
    source routing headers, leveraging loose source routing operations down the
    main RPL DODAG.
    
    A P-Route can also be used as a protection path, and it can be combined and interleaved with 
    other P-Routes to form a Recovery Graph called a Track. 
    A Track is signaled as a separate RPL Instance that is associated with 
    a main RPL Instance, such that the RPL routers that form the Track
    are also members of the main DODAG.
    The Track provides underlay shortcuts using its own RIB, that
    is separate from the RIB of the main Instance and has a higher precedence.

    <t>
	In this document, readers will encounter terms and concepts
	that are discussed in the <xref target='RFC6550'>"Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks"</xref>, the <xref target='RFC9030'> "6TiSCH Architecture"</xref>, the <xref target='RFC8655'>
    "Deterministic Networking Architecture"</xref>, the <xref target='RFC9008'>
    "Using RPI Option Type, Routing Header for Source Routes, and IP-in-IP
    Encapsulation in the RPL Data Plane"</xref>,
    the <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'>"Reliable and
    Available Wireless (RAW) Architecture"</xref>,
    and
    <xref target='RFC7102'>"Terminology in Low power And Lossy Networks"</xref>.

    The 6TiSCH and DetNet/RAW architectures utilize the terms "Track" and
    "Recovery Graph" to represent the same concept though in different environments.
    This document uses "Track" to represent that concept, and only builds
    Tracks that are DODAGs, meaning that all links are oriented From Ingress to Egress.
    This specification also utilizes the terms segment and protection path that are also
    defined in the RAW Architecture.
    </t>
    <t>
    As opposed to routing trees, RPL DODAGs are typically constructed
    to provide redundancy and dynamically adapt the forwarding operation to the
    state of the LLN links. Note that the plain forwarding operation over DODAGs
    does not provide redundancy for all nodes, since at least the node nearest
    to the Root does not have an alternate feasible successor.
    </t>
    <t>
    RAW solves that problem by defining Protection Paths that can be interleaved
    to form new paths that can be activated dynamically upon failures. This requires
    additional control to take the routing decision early enough along the Track
    to route around the failure.
    </t>
    <t>
    RAW only uses single-ended DODAGs, meaning that they can be reversed in
    another DODAG by reversing all the links. The Ingress of the Track is the
    Root of the DODAG, whereas the Egress is the Root of the reversed DODAG.
    From the RAW perspective, single-ended DODAGs are special Tracks that only
    have forward links, and that can be leveraged to provide Protection
    services by defining destination-oriented Protection Paths within the DODAG.

    <!-- Removed reference from routing and 6tisch here to keep it simple -->
	 This specification uses the following terminology:
    </t>
  <section><name>Projected Route</name><t>
	 A RPL P-Route is a RPL route that is computed remotely by a PCE, and 
    installed and maintained by a RPL Root on behalf of the PCE. It
    is installed as a state that signals that destinations (i.e., Targets)
    are reachable via or along a sequence of nodes.</t>

  </section>
  <section><name>Projected DAO</name>
    <t> A DAO message used to install a P-Route. </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Path</name>
    <t>Quoting (non-normatively) section 1.1.3 of <xref target="RFC1122"/>:</t>
    <blockquote>
    At a given moment, all the IP datagrams from a particular source host to a
    particular destination host will typically traverse the same sequence of
    gateways.  We use the term "path" for this sequence.  Note that a path is
    uni-directional; it is not unusual to have different paths in the two
    directions between a given host pair.
    </blockquote>
    <t>
    Section 2 of <xref target="I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties"/> points to a longer, more modern definition of path, which begins as follows:</t>
    <blockquote>
      A sequence of adjacent path elements over which a packet can
      be transmitted, starting and ending with a node.  A path is
      unidirectional.  Paths are time-dependent, i.e., the sequence of
      path elements over which packets are sent from one node to another
      may change.  A path is defined between two nodes.
    </blockquote>
    <t>
    It follows that the general acceptance of a path is a linear sequence of
    nodes, as opposed to a multi-dimensional graph. In the context of this
    document, a path is observed by following one copy of a packet that is
    injected in a Track and possibly replicated within.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Routing Stretch</name>

  <t>
    RPL is anisotropic, meaning that it is directional, or more exactly polar.
    RPL does not behave the same way "downwards" (root towards leaves) with <em>multicast</em> DIO messages that
    form the DODAG and "upwards" (leaves towards root) with <em>unicast</em> DAO messages that follow the DODAG.
    This is in contrast with traditional IGPs that operate the same way in all
    directions and are thus called isotropic.
  </t>
  <t>The term Routing Stretch denotes the length of a path, in comparison to the length of the
    shortest path, which can be an abstract concept in RPL when the metrics are
    statistical and dynamic, and the concept of distance varies with the Objective
    Function.
  </t>
  <t>
    The RPL DODAG optimizes the P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint) (from the Root) and MP2P (Multipoint-to-Point) (towards the Root) paths, but
    the P2P (Point-to-Point) traffic has to follow the same DODAG. Following the
    DODAG, the RPL datapath passes via a common parent in Storing Mode and
    via the Root in Non-Storing Mode. This typically involves more hops and
    more latency than the minimum possible for a directional (i.e., forward) P2P path that an
    isotropic protocol would compute.
    We refer to this elongated path as stretched.
  </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Track</name>
    <t>
    The concept of Track is inherited from the <xref target='RFC9030'>
    "6TiSCH Architecture"</xref> and matches that of a Protection Path in the
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'> RAW Architecture"</xref>. A Track
    is a networking graph that can be followed to transport packets with
    equivalent treatment; as opposed to the definition of a path above,
    a Track is not necessarily linear. It may contain multiple paths that
    may fork and rejoin, and may enable the RAW Packet ARQ, Replication,
    Elimination, and Overhearing (PAREO) operations.
    </t>
    <t>
    <xref target='TRK'/> illustrates the mapping of the DODAG with the
    generic concept of a Track, with the DODAG Root acting as Ingress
    for the Track, and the mapping of protection paths and segments, and only forward
    segments, meaning that they are directional and progressing towards the
    destination. Note that East is represented on the left since the 
    packets are forwarded East-West.

    <t>
    This specification builds Tracks that are DODAGs oriented towards a Track
    Ingress, and the forward direction for packets is from the
    Track Ingress to one of the possibly multiple Track Egress Nodes, which is
    also down the DODAG.
    </t>
    <t>
    The Track may be strictly connected, meaning that the vertices are adjacent, or loosely connected, meaning that the vertices are connected using segments that are associated to the same Track.
    </t>
  <section><name>TrackID</name>
    <t>
    A RPL InstanceID (typically of a Local Instance) that identifies a Track
    using the namespace owned by the Track Ingress. For Local Instances,
    the TrackID is associated with the IPv6 Address of the Track Ingress that is
    used as DODAGID, and together they form a unique identification of the Track
    (see the definition of DODAGID in section 2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Namespace</name>
  <t>
    The term namespace is used to refer to the scope of the TrackID.
    The TrackID is locally significant within its namespace.
    For Local Instances, the namespace is identified by the DODAGID for the
    Track and the tuple (DODAGID, TrackID) is globally unique. For Global
    Instances, the namespace is the whole RPL domain.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section><name>Complex Track</name>
    <t>A Track that can be traversed via more than one path (e.g., a DODAG).
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Stand-Alone</name>
    <t>
    Refers to a segment or a protection path that is installed with a single P-DAO that
    fully defines the path, e.g., a stand-alone segment is installed
    with a single Storing Mode Via Information option (SM-VIO) all the way
    between Ingress and Egress.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Stitching</name>
    <t>
    This specification uses the term stitching to indicate that a track is
    piped to another one, meaning that traffic out of the first track is injected into
    the other track.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Protection Path</name>
    <t> The concept of protection path is defined in the
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'> RAW Architecture"</xref>
    as an end-to-end forward serial path.
    With this specification, a protection path is installed by the Root of the main
    DODAG using a Non-Storing Mode P-DAO message, e.g.,
    I --> F --> E in <xref target="TRK"/>.
    </t> <t>
    As the Non-Storing Mode Via Information option (NSM-VIO) can only signal
    sequences of nodes, it takes one Non-Storing Mode P-DAO message per protection path to
    signal the structure of a complex Track.
    </t> <t>
    Each NSM-VIO for the same
    TrackId but with a different Segment ID signals a different protection path that the
    Track Ingress adds to the topology.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section><name>Segment</name>
    <t>
    A serial path formed by a strict sequence of nodes, along which a P-Route is
    installed, e.g.,
    I ==> A ==> B ==> C in <xref target="TRK"/>.
    With this specification, a segment is typically installed by the Root of the
    main DODAG using Storing Mode P-DAO messages. A segment is used as
    the topological edge of a Track joining the loose steps along the protection paths that
    form the structure of a complex Track. The same segment may be leveraged by
    more than one protection path where the protection paths overlap.
    </t> <t>
    Since this specification builds only DODAGs,
    all segments are oriented from Ingress (East) to Egress (West), as opposed
    to the general Track model in the <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'>
    RAW Architecture</xref>, which allows North/South segments that can be
    bidirectional as well.
    </t>

  <section><name>Section of a Segment</name>
    <t>
    A continuous subset of a segment that may be replaced while the segment
    remains. For instance, in segment A=>B=>C=>D=>E=>F, say that the  link C to
    D might be misbehaving. The section B=>C=>D=>E in the segment may be
    replaced by B=>C’=>D’=>E to route around the problem. The segment becomes
    A=>B=>C’=>D’=>E=>F.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section anchor='SRSRH'><name>Segment Routing and SRH</name>
  <t>
   In a Non-Storing mode RPL domain, the IPv6 RH used for source-routing
   is the (RPL) SRH as defined in <xref target='RFC6554'/>. 
   This specification operates in that context and uses the acronym SRH
   to mean the IPv6 RH type 3 as opposed to the IPv6 RH type 4 defined 
   in <xref target='RFC8754'/> for the Segment Routing (SRv6) operation.
   </t>
   <t>
   If the network is a 6LoWPAN Network, the expectation is that the
   SRH is compressed and encoded as a 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH), as
   specified in section 5 of <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   </t> 
   <t>
   This specification uses the term "Segment Routing" generically, to
   refer to using source-routing to hop over segments. As such, 
   forwarding along segments as specified hereafter can be seen as a 
   form of Segment Routing <xref target='RFC8402'/>, but leveraging the 
   (RPL) SRH for its operation.
   </t> 
   <t>
   Outside of LLNs, the RPL Network may be less constrained and operated

<section anchor='onrpl'><name>RPL Applicability</name>
<t>
   RPL is optimized for situations where the power is scarce, the bandwidth is
   constrained and the transmissions are unreliable. This matches the use case of
   an IoT LLN where RPL is typically used today, but also situations of high relative
   mobility between the nodes in the network (a.k.a. swarming), e.g.,
   within a variable set of vehicles with a similar global motion, or a platoon of
   drones. 
   In contrast, this specification only applies when the platoon has a relatively stable 
   topology where the segments can be attributed a reliability and availability 
   for a certain lifetime, see <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'/>.
</t><t>
   To reach this goal, RPL is primarily designed to minimize the control plane
   activity, that is the relative amount of routing protocol exchanges vs. data
   traffic, and the amount of state that is maintained in each node. RPL does
   not need to converge, and provides connectivity to most nodes most of the time.
</t><t>
    RPL may form multiple topologies called instances. Instances can be
    created to enforce various optimizations through objective functions,
    or to reach out through different Root Nodes.  The concept of objective
    function allows to adapt the activity of the routing protocol to the use
    case, e.g., type, speed, and quality of the LLN links.
</t><t>
    RPL instances operate in parallel, unaware of one another. Yet, 
    it is possible to define a model whereby if a route cannot be found 
    in the current instance A where a packet is being forwarded, then
    the router may lookup the routing table (RIB) in an instance B and
    forward along instance B if the route is found there.
    To avoid loops, this must happen in such a way that the instances
    themselves form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) leading to the last
    resort instance that is the "lowest" instance if instance A is considered
    "higher" then instance B. This specification uses underlay Tracks as
    "lower" instances, the main instance being the "highest" of all. 
</t><t>
    The RPL Root is responsible for selecting the RPL Instance that is used
    to forward a packet coming from the Backbone into the RPL domain and for setting
    the related RPL information in the packets. Each Instance creates its own
    routing table (RIB) in participating nodes, and the RIB associated to the instance must be used end to end in the RPL domain. To that effect, RPL
    tags the packets with the Instance ID in a Hop-by-Hop extension Header.
    6TiSCH leverages RPL for its distributed routing operations.
</t><t>
   To reduce the routing exchanges, RPL leverages an anisotropic Distance Vector
   approach, which does not need a global knowledge of the topology, and only
   optimizes the routes to and from the RPL Root, allowing P2P paths to be
   stretched. Although RPL installs its routes proactively, it only maintains
   them lazily, in reaction to actual traffic, or as a slow background activity.
</t><t>
   This is simple and efficient in situations where the traffic is mostly
   directed from or to a central node, such as the control traffic between
   routers and a controller of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure or an Autonomic Control Plane (ACP).
</t><t>
   But stretch in P2P routing is counter-productive to both reliability and
   latency as it introduces additional delay and chances of loss. As a result,
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> is not a good fit for the use cases listed in the
   RAW use cases document <xref target='RFC9450'/>, which demand
   high availability and reliability, and as a consequence require both short
   and diverse paths.
</t>

</section>	<!-- end section "RPL Applicability" -->
<section anchor='onrplroute'><name>Multi-Topology Routing and Loop Avoidance</name>
<t>
   RPL first forms a default route in each node towards the Root, and those
   routes together coalesce as a Directed Acyclic Graph oriented upwards.
   RPL then constructs routes to destinations signaled as Targets in the reverse direction,
   down the same DODAG. To do so, a RPL Instance can be operated either in RPL
   Storing or Non-Storing Mode of Operation (MOP).
   The default route towards the Root is maintained aggressively and may change while a packet progresses without causing loops, so the packet will still reach the Root.
</t>
<t>In Non-Storing Mode, each node advertises itself as a Target directly to the
   Root, indicating the parents that may be used to reach itself. Recursively, the
   Root builds and maintains an image of the whole DODAG in memory, and
   leverages that abstraction to compute source route paths for the packets to
   their destinations down the DODAG. When a node changes its point(s)
   of attachment to the DODAG, it takes a single unicast packet to the Root along
   the default route to update it, and the connectivity to the node is restored
   immediately;
   this mode is preferable for use cases where internet connectivity is
   dominant, or when the Root controls the network activity in the
   nodes, which is the case of this specification.

</t>
<t>
   In Storing Mode, the routing information percolates upwards, and each
   node maintains the routes to the subDAG of its descendants down the
   DODAG.  The maintenance is lazy, either reactive upon traffic or as a
   slow background process.  Packets flow via the common parent and the
   routing stretch is reduced compared to Non-Storing MOP, for better P2P
   connectivity.  However, a new route takes a longer time to
   propagate to the Root, since it takes time for the Distance-Vector protocol to
   operate hop-by-hop, and the connectivity from the internet to the node is
   restored more slowly upon node movement.
</t>

    <t>

    Either way, the RPL routes are injected by the Target nodes, in a distributed fashion. To complement RPL and eliminate routing stretch, this specification introduces a hybrid mode that combines Storing and Non-Storing operations to build and project routes onto the nodes where they should be installed. This specification uses the term Projected Route (P-Route) to refer to those routes.
    </t>


<t>
   In the simplest mode of this specification, Storing-Mode P-Routes can be
   deployed to join the dots of a loose source routing header (SRH) in the main
   DODAG. In that case, all the routes (source routed and P-Routes) belong to
   the Routing Information base (RIB) associated with the main Instance.
   Storing-Mode P-Routes are referred to as segments in this specification.

    </t>
<t>A set of P-Routes can also be projected to form a dotted-line underlay of the
    main Instance and provide Traffic Engineered paths for an application.
   In that case, the P-Routes are installed in Non-Storing Mode and the set
   of P-Routes is called a Track.
   A Track is associated with its own RPL Instance, and, as any RPL Instance,
   with its own Routing Information base (RIB). As a result, each Track defines
   a routing topology in the RPL domain. As for the main DODAG, segments
   associated to the Track Instance may be deployed to join the dots using
   Storing-Mode P-Routes.
    </t>
<t>
   Routing in a multi-topology domain may cause loops unless strict rules are
   applied. This specification defines two strict orders to ensure loop
   avoidance when projected routes are used in a RPL domain, one between
   forwarding methods and one between RPL Instances, seen as routing topologies.
   </t>   <t>
   The first and strict order relates to the forwarding method and the more
   specifically the origin of the information used in the next-hop computation.
   The possible forwarding methods are: 1) to a direct next hop, 2) to an indirect
   neighbor via a common neighbor, 3) along a segment, and 4) along a nested Track.
   The methods are strictly ordered as listed above, more in <xref target = "routing"/>.
   A forwarding method may leverage any of the lower order ones, but never one
   with a higher order; for instance, when forwarding a packet along a segment,
   the router may use direct or indirect neighbors but cannot use a Track.
   The lower order methods have a strict precedence, so the router will always
   prefer a direct neighbor over an indirect one, or a segment within the
   current RPL Instance vs. another Track.

</t>   <t>

   The second strict and partial order is between RPL Instances. It allows the
   RPL node to detect an error in the state installed by the
   PCE, e.g., after a desynchronization.
   That order must be defined by the administrator for the RPL domain and
   defines a DODAG of underlays with the main Instance as Root.

   The relation of RPL instances may be represented as a DODAG of instances
   where the main instance is Root. The rule is that a RPL Instance may leverage
   another RPL instance as underlay if and only if
   that other Instance is one of its descendants in the graph.

   Supporting this method is OPTIONAL for nested Tracks and REQUIRED between
   a Track instance and the main instance.

   <!-- The way this graph is communicated to the  RPL nodes is out of scope. -->
   It may be done using network management, or future extensions to this
   specifications. When it is not communicated, then the RPL nodes consider by
   default that all Track instances are children of the main instance, and do not
   attempt to validate the order for nested Tracks, trusting the PCE implicitly.
   As a result, a packet that is being forwarded along the main Instance may be
   encapsulated in any Track, but a packet that was forwarded along a Track MUST
   NOT be forwarded along the default route of main Instance.

	  <t>A RPL implementation operating in a very constrained LLN typically uses
      the Non-Storing Mode of Operation as represented in <xref target='nost'/>.
      In that mode, a RPL node indicates a
      parent-child relationship to the Root, using a destination Advertisement
      Object (DAO) that is unicast from the node directly to the Root,
      and the Root typically builds a source routed path to a destination down
      the DODAG by recursively concatenating this information.

 <t>
   Based on the parent-children relationships expressed in the Non-
   Storing DAO messages, the Root possesses topological information
   about the whole network, though this information is limited to the
   structure of the DODAG for which it is the destination.  A packet
   that is generated within the domain will always reach the Root, which
   can then apply a source routing information to reach the destination
   if the destination is also in the DODAG.  Similarly, a packet coming
   from the outside of the domain for a destination that is expected to
   be in a RPL domain reaches the Root.  This results in the wireless
   bandwidth near the Root being the limiting factor for all transmissions
   towards or within the domain, and that the Root is a single point of
   failure for all connectivity to nodes within its domain.

 </t>
 <t>
   The RPL Root must add a source routing header to all downward packets.
   As a network grows, the size of the source routing header increases
   with the depth of the network.  In some use cases, a RPL network forms
   long lines along physical structures such as streets for lighting.
   Limiting the packet size is beneficial to the energy budget, directly
   for the current transmission, but also indirectly since it reduces the
   chances of frame loss and energy spent in retries, e.g., by ARQ over one hop
   at Layer-2, or end-to-end at upper layers.
   Using smaller packets also reduces the chances of
   packet fragmentation, which is highly detrimental to the LLN operation, in
   particular when fragments are forwarded but not recovered, see
   <xref target="RFC8930"/> vs. <xref target="RFC8931"/> for more.

 </t>
 <t>
   A limited amount of well-targeted routing state would allow the
   source routing operation to be loose as opposed to strict, and reduce the
   overhead of routing information in packets.
   Because the capability to store routing state in every node
   is limited, the decision of which route is installed where can only
   be optimized with global knowledge of the system, knowledge that
   the Root or an associated PCE may possess by means that are outside
   the scope of this specification.
 </t>
 <t>
   Being on-path for all packets in Non-Storing mode, the Root may
   determine the number of P2P packets in its RPL domain per source and
   destination, the latency incurred, and the amount of energy and
   bandwidth that is consumed to reach itself and then back down, including
   possible fragmentation when encapsulating larger packets.  Enabling
   a shorter path that would not traverse the Root for select P2P
   source/destinations may improve the latency, lower the consumption of
   constrained resources, free bandwidth at the bottleneck near the
   Root, improve the delivery ratio and reduce the latency for those P2P
   flows with a global benefit for all flows by reducing the load at the
   Root.
 </t>

      <t>
      To limit the need for source route headers in deep networks, one possibility
      is to store a routing state associated with the main DODAG in select RPL
      routers down the path. The Root may elide the sequence of routers
      that is installed in the network from its source route header, which therefore
      becomes loose, in contrast to being strict in <xref target="RFC6550"/>.

      <xref target="RFC6550"/> optimizes P2MP routes from the Root, MP2P routes towards the
      Root, and as a consequence routes from/to the outside of the RPL domain when the Root also serves as Border Router.
      All routes are installed North-South (a.k.a. up/down) along the RPL DODAG.
      Peer to Peer (P2P) forward routes in a RPL network will generally

     <t>As described in <xref target="RFC9008" />, the amount of stretch depends on the Mode of Operation: </t>
    <ul spacing='normal'>
        <li> in Non-Storing Mode, all packets
     routed within the DODAG flow all the way up to the Root of the DODAG. If
     the destination is in the same DODAG, the Root must encapsulate the packet
     to place an RH that has the strict source route information down
     the DODAG to the destination. This will be the case even if the destination
     is relatively close to the source and the Root is relatively far off.
        </li>
        <li>In Storing Mode, unless the destination is a child of the source,
     the packets will follow the default route up the DODAG as well.
     If the destination is in the same DODAG, they will eventually reach a
     common parent that has a route to the destination; at worse, the common
     parent may also be the Root. From that common parent, the packet will
     follow a path down the DODAG that is optimized for the Objective Function
     that was used to build the DODAG.</li>
        </ul>


     <t>
     It turns out that it is often beneficial to enable direct P2P routes,
     either if the RPL route presents a stretch from the shortest path, or if the
     new route is engineered with a different objective, and this is
     even more critical in Non-Storing Mode than it is in Storing Mode, because
     the routing stretch is wider.
     For that reason, earlier work at the IETF introduced the
     <xref target='RFC6997'>"Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in
     Low Power and Lossy Networks"</xref>, which specifies a distributed method for

<section anchor='tracks'><name>On Tracks</name>
<section anchor='ctracks'><name>Building Tracks With RPL</name>

    <t>
    The concept of a Track was introduced in the <xref target='RFC9030'>
    "6TiSCH Architecture"</xref>, as a collection of potential paths that
    leverage redundant forwarding solutions along the way. This can be a
    DODAG or a more complex structure that is only partially acyclic
    (e.g., per packet).
    </t>
<t>
    With this specification, a Track is shaped as a DODAG, and following the
    directed edges leads to a Track Ingress. Storing Mode P-DAO messages follow
    the direction of the edges to set up routes for traffic that flows the
    other way, towards the Track Egress(es). If there is a single Track Egress,
    then the Track is reversible to form another DODAG by reversing the
    direction of each edge. A node at the Ingress of more than one segment in a
    Track may use one or more of these segments to forward a packet inside the
    Track.
    </t>
<t>
   A RPL Track is a collection of (one or more) parallel loose source routed
   sequences of nodes ordered from Ingress to Egress, each forming a protection path.
   The nodes in a Track are directly connected, reachable via existing Tracks as
   illustrated in <xref target='nssr'/>  or joined with strict segments of
   other nodes as shown in <xref target='srpdao'/>.
   The protection paths are expressed in RPL Non-Storing Mode and require an encapsulation
   to add a Source Route Header, whereas the segments are expressed in RPL
   Storing Mode.
</t>
<t>
   A path provides only one path between Ingress and Egress.
   It comprises exactly one protection path. A Stand-Alone segment implicitly defines a
   path from its Ingress to Egress.
</t>

<t> A complex Track forms a graph that provides a collection of potential paths
    to provide redundancy for the packets, either as a collection of protection paths that
    may be parallel or interleaved at certain points, or as a more generic DODAG.
</t>


</section><!-- Building Tracks -->
<section anchor='stracks'><name>Tracks and RPL Instances</name>

   <t>
   Section 5.1. of <xref target='RFC6550'/> describes the RPL Instance and
   its encoding. There can be up to 128 Global RPL Instances, for which there
   can be one or more DODAGs, and there can be 64 local RPL Instances, with a
   namespace that is indexed by a DODAGID, where the DODAGID is a Unique Local
   Address (ULA) or a Global Unicast Address (GUA) of the Root of the DODAG.
   Bit 0 (most significant) is set to 1 to signal a Local RPLInstanceID, as
   shown in <xref target='rpid'/>. By extension, this specification expresses
   the value of the RPLInstanceID as a single integer between 128 and 191,
   representing both the Local RPLInstanceID in 0..63 in the rightmost bits
   and Bit 0 set.
   </t>

<figure anchor='rpid'><name>Local RPLInstanceID Encoding</name>

           Bit 0 set to 1 signals a local RPLInstanceID
 </artwork>
</figure>
   <t>
   A Track typically forms an underlay to the main Instance, and is associated
   with a Local RPL Instance from which the RPLInstanceID is used as the TrackID.
   When a packet is placed on a Track, it is encapsulated IP-in-IP with a
   RPL Option containing a RPI which signals the RPLInstanceID.
   The encapsulating source IP address and RPI Instance are set to the Track
   Ingress IP address and local RPLInstanceID, respectively, more in
   <xref target='trkid'/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   A Track typically offers service protection across several protection paths.
   As a degraded form of a Track, a path made of a single protection path
   (i.e., offering no protection) can be used as an alternative to a segment for
   forwarding along a RPL Instance.
   In that case, instead of following native routes along the instance, the
   packets are encapsulated to signal a more specific source-routed path between
   the loose hops in the encapsulated source routing header.
   </t><t>
   If the
   encapsulated packet follows a global instance, then the protection path may be part of that
   global instance as well, for instance the global instance of the main DODAG.
   This can only be done for global instances because the Ingress node that
   encapsulates the packets over the protection path is not the Root of the instance,
   so the source address of the encapsulated packet cannot be used to determine
   the Track along the way.

    <section><name>path Signaling</name>
<t>
   This specification enables setting up a P-Route along either a protection path or a
   segment. A P-Route is installed and maintained by the Root of the main DODAG
   using an extended RPL DAO message called a Projected DAO (P-DAO), and a Track
   is composed of the combination of one or more P-Routes. In order to clarify
   the techniques that may be used to install a P-Route, this section takes the
   simple case of the path illustrated in <xref target='reft'/>.
   So the goal is to build a path from node A to E for packets towards E's
   neighbors F and G along A, B, C, D and E as opposed to via the Root:

<t>
   A P-DAO message for a Track signals the TrackID in the RPLInstanceID field.
   In the case of a local RPL Instance, the address of the Track Ingress is
   used as source to encapsulate packets along the Track. The Track is signaled
   in the DODAGID field of the Projected DAO Base Object,
   see <xref target='p-dao-fmt'/>.
</t><t>
   This specification introduces the Via Information Option (VIO) to signal a sequence of hops in a
   protection path or a segment in the P-DAO messages, either in Storing Mode (SM-VIO) or
   Non-Storing Mode (NSM-VIO). One P-DAO message contains a single VIO,
   associated to one or more RPL Target Options that signal the destination
   IPv6 addresses that can reached along the Track (more in <xref target='viof'/>).
</t>
<t>
   Before diving deeper into Track and segment signaling and operation,
   this section provides examples of how route projection works through
   variations of a simple example. This simple example illustrates the case of
   host routes, though RPL Targets can also be prefixes.
</t>

<t>
   Conventionally we use  ==&gt; to represent a strict hop and --&gt; for a
   loose hop.
   We use "-to-", such as in C==&gt;D==&gt;E-to-F to represent coma-separated
   Targets, e.g., F is a Target for segment C==&gt;D==&gt;E.
   In this example, A is the Track Ingress and E is the Track Egress. C is a stitching
   point. F and G are "external” Targets for the Track, and become reachable
   from A via the Track A (Ingress) to E (Egress and implicit Target in
   Non-Storing Mode) leading to F and G (explicit Targets).

</t>
<t>
In a general manner the desired outcome is as follows:
</t>

<ul>
<li>Targets are E, F, and G </li>
<li>P-DAO 1 signals C==&gt;D==&gt;E</li>
<li>P-DAO 2 signals A==&gt;B==&gt;C</li>
<li>P-DAO 3 signals F and G via the A--&gt;E Track</li>
</ul>

<t>
   P-DAO 3 may be ommitted if P-DAO 1 and 2 signal F and G as Targets.
</t>
<t>
   Loose sequences of hops are expressed in Non-Storing Mode; this is why P-DAO 3
   contains a NSM-VIO. With this specification:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
   the DODAGID to be used by the Ingress as source address is signaled
   in the DAO base object (see <xref target='p-dao-fmt'/>) .
</li><li>
   the via list in the VIO  is encoded as an SRH-6LoRH (see <xref target='viao'/>),
   and it starts with the address of the first hop node after the Ingress node
   in the loose hop sequence.
</li><li>
the via list ends with the address of the Egress node.
</li>
</ul>
<t> Note well:
</t>
<blockquote>
   The Egress of a Non-Storing Mode P-Route is implicitly a target; it is
   not listed in the RPL Target Options but still accounted for as if it was.
   The only exception is when the Egress is the only address listed in the
   VIO, in which case it would indicate via itself which would be non-sensical.
   </blockquote>
<t>
Also:
</t>

<blockquote>
   By design, the list of nodes in a VIO in Non-Storing Mode is
   exactly the list that shows in the encapsulation SRH. So in the cases
   detailed below, if the Mode of the P-DAO is Non-Storing, then the VIO
   row can be read as indicating the SRH as well.

    <section anchor="usms"><name>Using Storing Mode Segments</name>
<t>
    A==&gt;B==&gt;C and C==&gt;D==&gt;E are segments of the same Track.
    Note that the Storing Mode signaling imposes strict continuity in a segment, since the P-DAO is passed hop by hop, as a classical DAO is,
    along the reverse datapath that it signals.
    One benefit of strict routing is that loops are avoided along the Track.

   Note in the above that the segment can terminate at the loose hop as used in
   the example of P-DAO 1 or at the previous hop as done with P-DAO 2.
   Both methods are possible on any segment joined by a loose protection path. P-DAO 1
   generates more signaling since E is the segment Egress when D could be, but
   has the benefit that it validates that the connectivity between D and E still
   exists.

<!-- COMMENT: I know this may take some effort, sorry, but I think it would be really useful in the Packet Header Settings tables, here and further below, to also include a column indicating the contents of the SRH. The lack of this made it more complicated, especially in the more complicated cases further along, to understand what's going on.

   AUTH: actually that was easy. Because it's already there. I added at the
   beginning of the section
      Note well: by design, the list of nodes in a VIO in Non-Storing Mode is
   exactly the list that shows in the encapsulation SRH. So in the cases
   detailed below, if the Mode of the P-DAO is Non-Storing, then the VIO
   row can be read as indicating the SRH as well.

As an example, say that A has a packet for F. Using the RIB in <xref target='RIBcase13'/>:
</t>
<ul>
<li>From P-DAO 3: A encapsulates the packet the Track signaled by P-DAO 3, with the outer header above.
Now the destination in the IPv6 Header is C, and a SRH signals the final destination is E.</li>
<li>From P-DAO 2: A forwards to B and B forwards to C.</li>
<li>From P-DAO 3: C processes the SRH and sets the destination in the IPv6 Header to E.</li>
<li>From P-DAO 1: C forwards to D and D forwards to E; E decapsulates the packet.</li>
<li>From the Neighbor Cache Entry: E delivers packets to F or G.</li>

    Packets originated at A to E, F and G could be generated with the RPI and the SRH, and no encapsulation.
    Alternatively, A may generate a native packet to the target, and then encapsulate it with an RPI and an SRH indicating the source-routed path leading to E, as it would for a packet that it routes coming from another node. This is effectively the same case as for packets generated by the root in a RPL network in Non-Storing mode, see section 8.1.3 of <xref target='RFC9008'/>. The latter is often is preferred since it leads to a single code path, and the destination when it is F or G, does not need to understand and process the RPI or the SRH.

    Either way, the packets to E, F, or G carry an SRH via B and C, and when they reach C, C needs to encapsulate them again
    to add an SRH via D and E.
    The encapsulating headers of packets that are forwarded along the Track
    between C and E have the following settings:

   Quote from section 5.3


      In the case of an NSM-VIO, the complete list can be loose and
      excludes the Ingress node, starting at the first loose hop and
      ending at a Track Egress; the Track Egress MUST be considered as

<t>To increase the reliability of the P2P transmission, this specification
   enables building a collection of protection paths between the same Ingress and Egress
   Nodes and combining them within the same TrackID, as shown in <xref
   target="FigLegs"/>.
Protection paths may be interleaved at the edges of loose hops or remain parallel.
</t><t>
   The segments that join the loose hops of a protection path are installed with the same
   TrackID as the protection path. But each individual protection path and segment has its own
   P-RouteID which allows it to be managed separately. Two protection paths of the same
   Track may cross at a common node that participates to a segment of Each
   protection path, or may be joined by additional segments. 
   The final path of a packet may then be the result of interleaving
   those two (and possibly more) protection paths.
   In that case the common node has more than one next hop in its RIB
   associated to the Track, but no specific signal in the packet to indicate
   which segment is being followed. A next hop that can reach the loose hop is
   selected.

   Note that while this specification enables building both segments inside a
   protection path, for instance segment 2 above which is within protection path 1,
   and Inter-protection-path segments (i.e., North-South), for instance  segment 5 above which joins
   protection path 1 and protection path 2, it does not signal to the Ingress which Inter-protection-path segments
   are available, so the use of North-South segments and associated path redundancy
   functions is currently limited. The only possibility available at this time
   is to define overlapping protection paths as illustrated in <xref target="FigLegs"/>,
   with protection path 3 that is congruent with protection path 1 until node B and congruent with protection path
   2 from node H on, abstracting segment 5 as a forward segment.

    This specification expects that the main DODAG is operated in RPL
    Non-Storing Mode to sustain the exchanges with the Root. Based on its
    comprehensive knowledge of the parent-child relationship, the Root can form
    an abstracted view of the whole DODAG topology. This document adds the
    capability for nodes to advertise additional sibling information to

    and enable the PCE to build more / better paths that traverse those siblings.

    P-Routes require resources such as routing table space in the
    routers and bandwidth on the links; the amount of state that
    is installed in each node must be computed to fit within the node's memory,
    and the amount of rerouted traffic must fit within the capabilities of
    the transmission links. The methods used to learn the node capabilities and
    the resources that are available in the devices and in the network are out
    of scope for this document. The method to capture and report the LLN link
    capacity and reliability statistics are also out of scope. They may be

<section anchor='pmce'><name>Leveraging PCE</name>
<t>
    With DetNet and 6TiSCH, the component of the controller that is responsible
    of computing routes is a PCE. The PCE
    computes its routes based on its own objective functions such as described
    in <xref target='RFC4655'/>, and typically controls the routes using the
    PCE Protocol (PCEP) by <xref target='RFC5440'/>.  While this specification
    expects a PCE and while PCEP might effectively be used between the Root and
    the PCE, the control protocol between the PCE and the Root is out of scope.
</t>
    <t>
    This specification also expects a single PCE with a full view of the
    network. Distributing the PCE function for a large network is out of scope.
    This specification uses the RPL Root as a proxy to the PCE. The PCE may be
    collocated with the Root, or may reside in an external Controller.
    In that case, the protocol between the Root and the PCE is out of scope
    and mapped to RPL inside the DODAG; one possibility is for
    the Root to transmit to the PCEs the information it received in RPL DAOs
    including all the SIOs that detail the parent/child and sibling information.
    </t>

    <t>
    The algorithm to compute the paths, the protocol used by the PCE
    and the metrics and link statistics involved in the computation are also out
    of scope. The effectiveness of the route computation by the PCE depends on
    the quality of the metrics that are reported from the RPL network.
    Which metrics are used and how they are reported is out of scope, but the
    expectation is that they are mostly of a long-term, statistical nature, and
    provide visibility on link throughput, latency, stability and availability
    over relatively long periods.

<section anchor='mraw'><name>Providing for RAW</name>
    <t>
    The <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'>RAW Architecture</xref> extends the definition of
    Track, as being composed of forward directional segments and North-South
    bidirectional segments, to enable additional path diversity, using Packet ARQ, Replication, Elimination, and Overhearing (PAREO) functions over the available paths, to provide a dynamic balance between the reliability and availability requirements of the flows and the need to conserve energy and spectrum. This specification prepares for RAW by setting up the Tracks, but only forms DODAGs, which are composed  of aggregated end-to-end loose source routed protection paths, joined by strict routed segments, all oriented forward.
     </t>
    <t>
    The RAW Architecture defines a dataplane extension of the PCE called the Point of Local Repair (PLR), that adapts the use of the path redundancy within a Track to defeat the diverse causes of packet loss.  The PLR controls the forwarding operation of the packets within a Track.
    This specification can use but does not impose a PLR and does not provide
    the policies that would select which packets are routed through which
    path within a Track, in other words, how the PLR may use the path redundancy within
    the Track. By default, the use of the available redundancy is limited to simple load balancing, and all the segments are forward unidirectional only.
    </t>
    <t>
    A Track may be set up to reduce the load around the Root, or to enable
    urgent traffic to flow more directly. This specification does not provide
    the policies that would decide which flows are routed through which Track.
    In a Non-Storing Mode RPL Instance, the main DODAG provides a default route
    via the Root, and the Tracks provide more specific routes to the Track
    Targets.

  <section anchor='ext'><name>Extending existing RFCs </name>

  <t>
    This section explains which changes are extensions to existing
    specifications, and which changes are amendments to existing
    specifications.
    It is expected that extensions to existing specifications do not cause
    existing code on legacy 6LRs to malfunction, as the extensions will
    simply be ignored.  New code is required for an extension.
    Those 6LRs will be unable to participate in the new mechanisms, but may
    also cause projected DAOs to be impossible to install.
    Amendments to existing specifications are situations where there are
    semantic changes required to existing code, and which may require new unit
    tests to confirm that legacy operations will continue unaffected.
  </t>

    <section anchor='ext6550'><name>Extending RPL RFC 6550</name>
    <t>
    This specification Extends RPL <xref target='RFC6550'/> to enable the Root
    to install forward routes inside a main DODAG that is operated as
    Non-Storing Mode. The Root issues a Projected DAO (P-DAO) message
    (see <xref target='extP-DAO'/>) to the Track Ingress; the P-DAO message
    contains a new Via Information Option (VIO) that installs a strict
    or a loose sequence of hops to form a Track segment or a
    protection path, respectively.
    </t>
    <t>
    The P-DAO Request (PDR) is a new message detailed in <xref target='P-DAOreq'/>.
    As per <xref target="RFC6550" /> section 6, if a node receives this message and
    it does not understand this new Code, it then discards the message.
    When the Root initiates communication to a node that it has not communicated
    with before and which it has not ascertained to implement this specification
    (by means such as capabilities), then the Root SHOULD request
    a PDR-ACK.
    </t>

    <t>
    A P-DAO Request (PDR) message
    enables a Track Ingress to request the Track from the Root. The
    resulting Track is also a DODAG for which the Track Ingress is the Root,
    the owner the address that serves as DODAGID and authoritative for the
    associated namespace from which the TrackID is selected. In the
    context of this specification, the installed route appears as a more
    specific route to the Track Targets, and the Track Ingress forwards
    the packets towards the Targets via the Track using normal longest
	match IP forwarding.
    </t>
    <t>
    To ensure that the PDR and P-DAO messages can flow at most times,
    it is RECOMMENDED that the nodes involved in a Track maintain
    multiple parents in the  main DODAG, advertise them all to the Root,
    and use them in turn to retry similar packets. It is also
    RECOMMENDED that the Root uses diverse source route paths to retry
    similar messages to the nodes in the Track.
    </t>
    <section anchor='extP-DAO'><name>Projected DAO</name>


   <t>
   Section 6 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> introduces the RPL Control Message
   Options (CMO), including the RPL Target Option (RTO) and Transit Information
   Option (TIO), which can be placed in RPL messages such as the destination
   Advertisement Object (DAO). A DAO message signals routing information to one
   or more Targets indicated in RTOs, and provides one and only one via-node in
   the TIO, the via-node being the tunnel end-point to reach the targets.
   </t>
   <t>
     This document Amends the specification of the DAO to create the P-DAO
     message.
     This Amended DAO is signaled with a new "Projected DAO" (P) flag, see <xref target=
     'p-dao-fmt'/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   A Projected DAO (P-DAO) is a special DAO message generated by the
   Root to install a P-Route formed of multiple hops in its DODAG. This provides
   a RPL-based method to install the Tracks as expected by the 6TiSCH
   Architecture  <xref target='RFC9030'/> as a collection of multiple P-Routes.
   </t>
   <t>
   The Root MUST source the P-DAO message with its address that serves as
   DODAGID for the main DODAG. The receiver MUST NOT accept a P-DAO message that
   is not sent by the Root of its DODAG and MUST ignore such messages silently.
   </t>
   <t>
   The 'P' flag is encoded in bit position 2 (to be confirmed by
   IANA) of the Flags field in the DAO Base Object. The Root MUST set it to 1 in
   a Projected DAO message. Otherwise it MUST be set to 0. It is set to 0 in
   Legacy implementations as specified respectively in Sections 20.11 and 6.4 of
   <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   The P-DAO is a part of control plane signaling and should not be stuck behind high
   traffic levels. The expectation is that the P-DAO message is sent at high
   QoS level, above that of data traffic, typically with the Network Control
   precedence.

   In RPL Non-Storing Mode, the TIO and RTO are combined in a DAO message to

   that a given parent can be used to reach a given child. The P-DAO message
   generalizes the DAO to signal to the Track Ingress that a Track for which it
   is Root can be used to reach children and siblings of the Track Egress.
   In both cases, options may be factorized and multiple RTOs may be present to
   signal a collection of children that can be reached through the parent or

   the DODAG to form and then maintain its structure.  The DODAG
   Configuration option is copied unmodified from parents to children.
   </t>
      <t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> states that:
</t>
<blockquote>
   Nodes other than the DODAG root MUST NOT modify this information when propagating the DODAG Configuration option.
</blockquote>
   <t>
   Therefore, a legacy parent propagates the 'D' flag as set
   by the root, and when the 'D' flag is set to 1, it is transparently
   flooded to all the nodes in the DODAG.

    <t> The <xref target='RFC8138'>6LoWPAN Routing Header</xref> specification
    introduces a new IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network
    (6LoWPAN) <xref target='RFC6282'/> dispatch type for use in 6LoWPAN
    route-over topologies, which initially covers the needs of RPL data packet
    compression.
    </t>
    <t>Section 4 of <xref target='RFC8138'/> presents the generic formats of
    the 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH) with two forms, one Elective that can
    be ignored and skipped when the router does not understand it, and one
    Critical which causes the packet to be dropped when the router cannot
    process it. The 'E' Flag in the 6LoRH indicates its form. In order to skip
    the Elective 6LoRHs, their format imposes a fixed expression of the size,
    whereas the size of a Critical 6LoRH may be signaled in variable forms to
    enable additional optimizations.
    </t>
    <t>When the <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression is used, the Root of the
    main DODAG that sets up the Track also constructs the compressed routing
    header (SRH-6LoRH) on behalf of the Track Ingress, which saves the
    complexities of optimizing the SRH-6LoRH encoding in constrained code.
    The SRH-6LoRH is signaled in the NSM-VIO, in a fashion that it is ready
    to be placed as is in the packet encapsulation by the Track Ingress.
    </t>

    <t>Section 6.3 of <xref target='RFC8138'/> presents the formats of the
    6LoWPAN Routing Header of type 5 (RPI-6LoRH) that compresses the RPI for
    normal RPL operation. The format of the RPI-6LoRH is not suited for
    P-Routes since the O,R,F flags are not used and the Rank is unknown and
    ignored.
    </t><t>
    This specification extends <xref target="RFC8138" /> to introduce a new 6LoRH, the P-RPI-6LoRH that can be
    used in either Elective or Critical 6LoRH form,
    see <xref target='elec6lorhtbl'/> and <xref target='crit6lorhtbl'/>
    respectively. The new 6LoRH MUST be used as a Critical 6LoRH, unless an SRH-6LoRH is present and controls the routing decision, in which case it
    MAY be used in Elective form.
    </t>
    <t>
    The P-RPI-6LoRH is designed to compress the RPI along RPL P-Routes.
    Its format is as follows:

    <section anchor='P-DAOreq'><name>New P-DAO Request Control Message</name>

               <t>
   The P-DAO Request (PDR) message is sent by a Node in the main DODAG to the
   Root. It is a request to establish or refresh a Track where the node
   sending the PDR is
   Track Ingress, and signals whether an acknowledgment called PDR-ACK is
   requested or not.  A positive PDR-ACK indicates that the Track was built
   and that the Root commits to maintaining the Track for the negotiated lifetime.
   </t>
   <t>
   The main Root MAY indicate to the Track Ingress that the Track was terminated
   before its time and to do so, it MUST use an asynchronous PDR-ACK with a
   negative status.
   A status of "Transient Failure" (see <xref target=
   "iana-stats-rej"/>) is an indication that the PDR may be retried after a
   reasonable time that depends on the deployment. Other negative status
   values indicate a permanent error; the attempt must be abandoned until
   a corrective action is taken at the application layer or through network
   management.
   </t>
   <t>

    The Track Ingress to-be of the requested Track is indicated in the source IPv6
    address of the PDR, and the TrackID is indicated in the message itself.


   At least one RPL Target Option MUST be present in the message. If more than
   one RPL Target Option is present, the Root will provide a Track that reaches
   the first listed Target and a subset of the other Targets; the details of the
   subset selection are out of scope.
   The RTO signals the Track Egress (more in <xref target='req'/>).
    <!--
    TODO: A P-DAO parameter option MAY be present as well to provide additional
    information on the requested path.

    <t>
    The Sibling Information Option (SIO) provides information about siblings that
    could be used by the Root to form P-Routes. One or more SIO(s) may be placed
    in the DAO messages that are sent to the Root in Non-Storing Mode.
    </t>
    <t>
   To advertise a neighbor node, the router MUST have an active Address
   Registration from that sibling using <xref target='RFC8505'/>, for an address
   (ULA or GUA) that serves as identifier for the node. If this router also
   registers an address to that sibling, and the link has similar properties in
   both directions, only the router with the lowest Interface ID in its
   registered address needs to report the SIO, with the B flag set, and the Root
   will assume symmetry.
    </t>
    <t>
    The SIO carries a flag (B) that is set when similar performance can be
    expected in both directions, so the routing can consider that the information
    provided for one direction is valid for both. If the SIO is effectively
    received from both sides then the B flag MUST be ignored.
    The policy that describes the
    performance criteria, and how they are asserted is out of scope.
    In the absence of an external protocol to assert the link quality, the flag
    SHOULD NOT be set.

   To avoid the need of Path MTU Discovery by 6LoWPAN end-points, 
   6LoWPAN links are normally defined
   with a MTU of 1280 (see section 4 of <xref target='RFC4944'/>).
   Injecting packets in a Track typically involves an IP-in-IP encapsulation and
   additional IPv6 Extension Headers. This may cause fragmentation if the
   resulting packets exceed the MTU that is defined for the RPL domain.
</t>
 <t>
   Though fragmentation is possible in a 6LoWPAN LLN, e.g., using <xref
   target='RFC4944'/>, <xref target='RFC8930'/>, and/or <xref target='RFC8931'/>,
   it is RECOMMENDED to define an MTU that is larger than 1280 between RPL
   routers that form the main DODAG to allow for the necessary header additions,
   while still exposing 1280 to the 6LoWPAN end-point stacks.
</t>
</section><!--  RPL Network Setup -->
<section anchor='req'><name>Requesting a Track</name>

      <t>
      This specification introduces the PDR message, used by an LLN node to
      request the formation of a new Track for which this node is the Ingress.
      Note that the namespace for the TrackID is owned by the Ingress node,
      and in the absence of a PDR, there must be some procedure for the Root to
      assign TrackIDs in that namespace while avoiding collisions (more in
      <xref target='trkid'/>).
      </t>
      <t>
      The PDR signals the desired TrackID and the duration for which the Track should be established. Upon a PDR, the Root MAY install the Track as requested, in which case it answers with a PDR-ACK indicating the granted
      Track Lifetime.
      All the segments MUST be of a same mode, either Storing or Non-Storing.
      All the segments MUST be created with the same TrackID and the same DODAGID signaled in the P-DAO.
      </t>
      <t>
      The Root designs the Track as it sees best, and updates / changes the segments over time to serve the
      Track as needed.
      Note that there is no protocol element to notify to the requesting Track
      Ingress when changes happen deeper down the Track, so they are transparent
      to the Track Ingress. If the main Root cannot maintain an expected service
      level, then it needs to tear down the Track completely.
      The Segment Lifetime in the P-DAO messages does not need to be aligned to
      the Requested Lifetime in the PDR, or between P-DAO messages for different segments. 
      E.g., The Root may use shorter lifetimes for the segments
      and renew them or change them during the lifetime of the Track.
      All the components (protection paths and segments) of a Track MUST be destroyed
      (or have their lifetime elapsed) before the TrackID can be reused.
      </t>
      <t>
      When the Track Lifetime is relatively close to elapse - meaning in
      the order of the trip time from the node to the Root - the requesting node
      SHOULD resend a PDR using the TrackID in the PDR-ACK to extend the
      lifetime of the Track, else the Track will time out and the Root will tear
      down the whole structure.
      </t>
      <t>
      If the Track fails and cannot be restored, the
      Root notifies the requesting node asynchronously with a PDR-ACK
      with a Track Lifetime of 0, indicating that the Track has failed, and
      a PDR-ACK Status indicating the reason of the fault.

     <t>
     RPL defines the concept of an Instance to signal an individual
     routing topology, and multiple topologies can coexist in the same network.
     The RPLInstanceID is tagged in the RPI of every packet to signal which
     topology the packet actually follows.
     </t>
     <t>
     This specification leverages the RPL Instance model as follows:
     </t>
   <ul spacing='normal'>
     <li>
     <t>
     The main Root MAY use P-DAO messages to add better routes in the main
     Instance in conformance with the routing objectives in that Instance.
     </t>
     <t>
     To achieve this, the main Root MAY install a segment along a path down the
     main DODAG, which is operated in Non-Storing Mode. This enables a loose
     source routing and reduces the size of the Routing Header,
     see <xref target='loose'/>.
     The main Root MAY also install a protection path across the main DODAG to
     complement the routing topology.
     </t>
     <t>
     When adding a P-Route to the RPL main DODAG, the main Root MUST set the
     RPLInstanceID field of the P-DAO Base Object (see section 6.4.1. of <xref
     target='RFC6550'/>) to the RPLInstanceID of the main DODAG, and MUST NOT
     use the DODAGID field. A P-Route provides a longer match to the Target
     Address than the default route via the main Root, so it is preferred.
     </t>
     </li>
     <li>
     <t>
     The main Root MAY also use P-DAO messages to install a Track as an
     independent routing topology (say, Traffic Engineered) to achieve
     particular routing characteristics from an Ingress to Egress Endpoints.
     To achieve this, the main Root MUST set up a Local RPL Instance (see
     section 5 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>), and the Local RPLInstanceID serves
     as the TrackID.
     The TrackID MUST be unique for the IPv6 ULA or GUA of the Track Ingress
     that serves as DODAGID for the Track.
     </t>
     <t>
     This way, a Track is uniquely identified by the tuple (DODAGID, TrackID)
     where the TrackID is always represented with the D flag set to 0 (see
     also section 5.1. of <xref target='RFC6550'/>), indicating when used in an
     RPI that the source address of the IPv6 packet signals the DODAGID.
     </t>
     <t>
     The P-DAO Base Object MUST indicate the tuple (DODAGID, TrackID) that
     identifies the Track as shown in <xref target='p-dao-fmt'/>, and the
     P-RouteID that identifies the P-Route MUST be signaled in the VIO as shown
     in <xref target='viao'/>.
     </t>
     <t>
     The Track Ingress is the Root of the DODAG ID formed by the local RPL
     Instance. It owns the namespace of its TrackIDs, so it can pick any
     unused value to request a new Track with a PDR. In a particular deployment
     where PDRs are not used, a portion of the namespace can be administratively
     delegated to the main Root, meaning that the main Root is authoritative for
     assigning the TrackIDs for the Tracks it creates.
    </t>
     <t>
     With this specification, the main Root is aware of all the active Tracks,
     so it can also pick any unused value to form Tracks without a PDR. To avoid
     a collision of the main Root and the Track Ingress picking the same value
     at the same time, it is RECOMMENDED that the Track Ingress starts
     allocating the ID value of the Local RPLInstanceID (see section 5.1. of
     <xref target='RFC6550'/>) used as TrackIDs with the value 0 incrementing,
     while the Root starts with 63 decrementing.

   A Complex Track can be installed as a collection of P-Routes with the same DODAGID and Track ID. The Ingress of a Non-Storing Mode P-Route is the owner and Root of the DODAGID. The Ingress of a Storing Mode P-Route must be either the owner of the DODAGID, or a hop of a protection path of the same Track. In the latter case, the Targets of the P-Route must include the next hop of the protection path if there is one, to ensure forwarding continuity.
   In the case of a Complex Track, each segment is maintained independently and
   asynchronously by the Root, with its own lifetime that may be shorter, the
   same, or longer than that of the Track.
   </t>

   <t>A route along a Track for which the TrackID is not the RPLInstanceID of
   the main DODAG MUST be installed with a higher precedence than the routes
   along the main DODAG, meaning that:
   </t>
   <ul>
   <li>Longest match MUST be the prime comparison for routing.
   </li>
   <li>In case of equal length match, the route along the Track MUST be
   preferred vs. the one along the main DODAG.
   </li>
   <li>There SHOULD NOT be 2 different Tracks leading to the same Target from
   same Ingress node, unless there's a policy for selecting which packets use
   which Track; such a policy is out of scope.
   </li>
   <li>A packet that was routed along a Track MUST NOT be routed along the main
   DODAG again; if the destination is not reachable as a neighbor by the node
   where the packet exits the Track then the packet MUST be dropped.
   </li>
   </ul>


     <section anchor='trkpdao'><name>Signaling a Projected Route</name>
         <t>
    This specification adds a capability whereby the Root of a main DODAG installs
    a Track as a collection of P-Routes, using a Projected-DAO (P-DAO) message
    for each individual protection path or segment.
    The P-DAO signals a collection of Targets in the RPL Target Option(s) (RTO). Those Targets can be reached via a sequence of routers indicated in a VIO.
     </t> <t>
    Like a classical DAO message, a P-DAO causes a change of state only if it is
    "new" per section 9.2.2. "Generation of DAO Messages" of the <xref target='RFC6550'> RPL specification</xref>; this is determined using
    the Segment Sequence information from the VIO as opposed to the Path
    Sequence from a TIO. Also, a Segment Lifetime of 0 in a VIO indicates that the P-Route associated to the segment is to be removed. There are two Modes
    of operation for the P-Routes, the Storing and the Non-Storing Modes.
     </t> <t>
    A P-DAO message MUST be sent from the address of the Root that serves 
    as DODAGID for the main DODAG. It MUST contain either exactly one 
    sequence of one or more RTOs followed by one VIO, or any number of 
    sequences of one or more RTOs followed by one or more TIOs. 
    The former is the normal expression for this specification, whereas
    the latter corresponds to the variation for less-constrained
    environments described in <xref target='bfd'/>.
    
    </t> <t>
    A P-DAO that creates or updates a protection path MUST be sent to a GUA or a ULA
    of the Ingress of the protection path; it must contain the full list of hops in the
    protection path unless the protection path is being removed.
    A P-DAO that creates a new Track segment MUST be sent to a GUA or a ULA
    of the segment Egress and MUST signal the full list of hops in segment; a
    P-DAO that updates (including deletes) a section of a segment MUST be
    sent to the first node after the modified segment and signal the full
    list of hops in the section starting at the node that immediately
    precedes the modified section.
    </t> <t>
    In Non-Storing Mode, as discussed in <xref target='nsP-DAO'/>, the Root
    sends the P-DAO to the Track Ingress where the source-routing state is
    applied, whereas in Storing Mode, the P-DAO is sent to the last node on the
    installed path and forwarded in the reverse direction, installing a Storing
    Mode state at each hop, as discussed in <xref target='sP-DAO'/>.
    In both cases the Track Ingress is the owner of the Track, and it generates the P-DAO-ACK when the installation is successful.
    </t>
     <t>
    If the 'K' Flag is present in the P-DAO, the P-DAO must be acknowledged
    using a DAO-ACK that is sent back to the address of the Root from which the
    P-DAO was received. In most cases, the first node of the protection path, segment,
    or updated section of the segment is the node that sends the acknowledgment.
    The exception to the rule is when an intermediate node in a segment fails
    to forward a Storing Mode P-DAO to the previous node in the SM-VIO.
   </t>
    <t>
   In a No-Path Non-Storing Mode P-DAO, the SRH-6LoRH MUST NOT be present in the
   NSM-VIO; the state in the Ingress is erased regardless. In all other cases, a
   VIO MUST contain at least one Via Address, and a Via Address MUST NOT be
   present more than once, which would create a loop.
   </t>
   <t>
   A node that processes a VIO MAY verify whether any of these conditions
   happen, and when one does, it MUST ignore the P-DAO and reject it with a RPL
   Rejection Status of "Error in VIO" in the DAO-ACK, see <xref target='iana-stats-rpl-rej'/>.
   </t><t>
   Other errors than those discussed explicitly that prevent the installation of the
   route are acknowledged with a RPL Rejection Status of "Unqualified Rejection" in the DAO-ACK.

    <t>
     In order to install the relevant routing state along the segment ,
     the Root sends a unicast P-DAO message to the Track Egress router of the routing segment that is being installed. The P-DAO message contains a SM-VIO with the strict sequence of Via Addresses. The SM-VIO follows
     one or more RTOs indicating the Targets to which the Track leads. The SM-VIO contains a Segment Lifetime for which the state is to be maintained.
     </t><t>
     The Root sends the P-DAO directly to the Egress node of the segment.
     In that P-DAO, the destination IP address matches the last Via Address in
     the SM-VIO. This is how the Egress recognizes its role. In a similar
     fashion, the segment Ingress node recognizes its role because it matches the first
     Via Address in the SM-VIO.
     </t><t>
     The Egress node of the segment is the only node in the path that does not
     install a route in response to the P-DAO; it is expected to be already able
     to route to the Target(s) based on its existing tables.
     If one of the Targets is not known, the node MUST answer to the Root
     with a DAO-ACK listing the unreachable Target(s) in an RTO and a rejection
     status of "Unreachable Target".
    </t><t>
     If the Egress node can reach all the Targets, then it forwards the P-DAO
     with unchanged content to its predecessor in the segment as indicated in
     the list of Via Information options, and recursively the message is
     propagated
     unchanged along the sequence of routers indicated in the P-DAO, but in the
     reverse order, from Egress to Ingress.
     </t><t>
     The address of the predecessor to be used as destination of the propagated
     DAO message is found in the Via Address list, at the position preceeding the one
     that contains the address of the propagating node, which is used as source
     of the message.
    </t><t>
    Upon receiving a propagated DAO, all except the Egress router MUST install a
    route towards the DAO Target(s) via their successor in the SM-VIO. A router
    that cannot store the routes to all the Targets in a P-DAO MUST reject the
    P-DAO by sending a DAO-ACK to the Root with a Rejection Status of "Out of
    Resources" as opposed to forwarding the DAO to its predecessor in the list.
    The router MAY install additional routes towards the Via Addresses that appear in
    the SM-VIO after its own address, if any, but in case of a conflict or a lack of
    resource, the route(s) to the Target(s) are the ones that must be installed
    in priority.
    </t>
     <t>
     If a router cannot reach its predecessor in the SM-VIO, the router MUST send the DAO-ACK to the Root with a Rejection Status of "Predecessor Unreachable".
    </t>
    <t>
     The process continues until the P-DAO is propagated to the Ingress router of
     the segment, which answers with a DAO-ACK to the Root. The Root always
     expects a DAO-ACK, either from the Track Ingress with a positive status
     or from any node along the segment with a negative status. If the DAO-ACK
     is not received, the Root may retry the DAO with the same TID, or tear
     down the route.

   <t>As illustrated in <xref target='nsdf'/>,
   a Non-Storing Mode P-DAO installs a source-routed path within the Track indicated by the P-DAO Base Object, towards the Targets indicated in the Target Options. The source-routed path requires a Source-Routing header which implies an IP-in-IP encapsulation to add the SRH to an existing packet. It is sent to the Track Ingress which creates a tunnel associated with the Track, and
   connected routes over the tunnel to the Targets in the RTO. The tunnel encapsulation MUST incorporate a routing header via the list addresses listed in the VIO in the same order. The content of the NSM-VIO starting at the first SRH-6LoRH header MUST be used verbatim by the Track Ingress when it encapsulates a packet to forward it over the Track.

   <t>
   The next entry in the source-routed path must be either a neighbor of the
   previous entry, or reachable as a Target via another P-Route, either
   Storing or Non-Storing, which implies that the nested P-Route has to be
   installed before the loose sequence is, and that P-Routes must be installed
   from the last to the first along the datapath.
   For instance, a segment of a Track must be installed before the protection path(s) of
   the same Track that use it, and stitched segments must be installed in
   order from the last that reaches to the Targets to the first.
   </t>
   <t>
   If the next entry in the loose sequence is reachable over a Storing Mode P-Route, it MUST be the Target of a segment and the Ingress of a next segment, both already setup; the segments are associated with the same Track, which avoids the need of an additional encapsulation. For instance, in
   <xref target="srpdao"/>, segments A==>B-to-C and C==>D==>E-to-F must be
   installed with Storing Mode P-DAO messages 1 and 2 before the Track A-->C-->E-to-F that joins them can be installed with Non-Storing Mode P-DAO 3.
   </t>
   <t>
   Conversely, if it is reachable over a Non-Storing Mode P-Route, the next
   loose source-routed hop of the inner Track is a Target of a previously
   installed Track and the Ingress of a next Track, which requires a de- and a
   re-encapsulation when switching the outer Tracks that join the loose hops.
   This is examplified in <xref target="nssr"/> where Non-Storing Mode P-DAO 1
   and 2 install strict Tracks that Non-Storing Mode P-DAO 3 joins as a super
   Track. In such a case, packets are subject to double IP-in-IP encapsulation.

    <section anchor='teardown'><name>Tearing Down a P-Route</name>
    <t>
    A P-DAO with a lifetime of 0 is interpreted as a No-Path DAO and results in
    cleaning up existing state as opposed to refreshing an existing one or
    installing a new one. To tear down a Track, the Root must tear down all the
    Track segments and protection paths that compose it one by one.
    </t>
    <t>
    Since the state about a protection path of a Track is located only on the Ingress Node,
    the Root cleans up the protection path by sending an NSM-VIO to the Ingress indicating
    the TrackID and the P-RouteID of the protection path being removed, a Segment Lifetime
    of 0 and a newer Segment Sequence. The SRH-6LoRH with the Via Addresses in
    the NSM-VIO are not needed; it SHOULD NOT be placed in the message and MUST
    be ignored by the receiver. Upon that NSM-VIO, the Ingress node removes all
    state for that Track if any, and replies positively anyway.
    </t>
    <t>
    The Root cleans up a section of a segment by sending an SM-VIO to the last
    node of the segment, with the TrackID and the P-RouteID of the segment being
    updated, a Segment Lifetime of zero (0) and a newer Segment Sequence.
    The Via Addresses in the SM-VIO indicates the section of the segment being
    modified, from the first to the last node that is impacted. This can be the
    whole segment if it is totally removed, or a sequence of one or more nodes
    that have been bypassed by a segment update.
    </t>
    <t>
    The No-Path P-DAO is forwarded normally along the reverse list, even if the
    intermediate node does not find a segment state to clean up. This results in
    cleaning up the existing segment state if any, as opposed to refreshing an
    existing one or installing a new one.

     <section anchor='maintain'><name>Maintaining a Track</name>
     <t>
     Repathing a Track segment or protection path may cause jitter and packet misordering.
     For critical flows that require timely and/or
     in-order delivery, it might be necessary to deploy the PAREO functions
     <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'/> over a highly redundant Track.
     This specification allows to use more than one protection path for a Track, and 1+N
     packet redundancy.
     </t>
    <t>
     This section provides the steps to ensure that no packet is lost due to
     the operation itself.
     This is ensured by installing the new section from its last node to the
     first, so when an intermediate node installs a route along the new section,
     all the downstream nodes in the section have already installed their own.
     The disabled section is removed when the packets in-flight are forwarded
     along the new section as well.
     </t>
    <section anchor='maintainS'><name>Maintaining a Track Segment</name>

    <t>
    To modify a section of a segment between a first node and a second, downstream
    node (which can be the Ingress and Egress, respectively), while retaining those nodes
    in the segment, the Root sends an SM-VIO to the second node indicating the
    sequence of nodes in the new section of the segment. The SM-VIO indicates
    the TrackID and the P-RouteID of the segment being updated, and a newer
    Segment Sequence. The P-DAO is propagated from the second to the first node
    and on the way, it updates the state on the nodes that are common to the old
    and the new section of the segment and creates a state in the new nodes.
    </t>
    <t>
    When the state is updated in an intermediate node, that node might still
    receive packets that were in flight from the Ingress to self over the
    old section of the segment. Since the remainder of the segment is already
    updated, the packets are forwarded along the new version of the segment from
    that node on.
    </t>
    <t>
    After a reasonable time to enable the deprecated sections to drain their traffic, the Root
    tears down the remaining section(s) of the old segments as
    described in <xref target='teardown'/>.
    </t>
    </section>  <!-- Maintaining a Track Segment -->

    <section anchor='maintainT'><name>Maintaining a protection path</name>

     <t>This specification allows the Root to add protection paths to a Track by sending
     a Non-Storing Mode P-DAO to the Ingress associated to the same TrackID,
     and a new Segment ID. If the protection path is loose, then the segments that join
     the hops must be created first.  It makes sense to add a new protection path before
     removing one that is becoming excessively lossy, and switch to the new
     protection path before removing the old. Dropping a Track before the new one is
     installed would reroute the traffic via the root; this may increase the
     latency beyond acceptable thresholds, and overload the network near the root.
     This may also cause loops in the case of stitched Tracks: the packets that
     cannot be injected in the second Track might be routed back and reinjected
     at the Ingress of the first.

     </t>
     <t>
     It is also possible to update a protection path by sending a Non-Storing Mode
     P-DAO to the Ingress with the same Segment ID, an incremented Segment
     Sequence, and the new complete list of hops in the NSM-VIO.
     Updating a live protection path means changing one or more of the intermediate loose
     hops, and involves laying out new segments from and to the new loose hops
     before the NSM-VIO for the new protection path is issued.
     </t>
    <t>
    Packets that are in flight over the old version of the protection path still
    follow the old source route path over the old segments.
    After a reasonable time to enable the deprecated segments to drain their traffic, the Root
    tears down those segments as described in <xref target='teardown'/>.

   <section anchor='routing'><name>Encapsulating and Forwarding Along a Track</name>



    <t>
   When injecting a packet in a Track, the Ingress router must
   encapsulate the packet using IP-in-IP to add the Source Routing Header with
   the final destination set to the Track Egress.
   </t>

    <t>
     All properties of a Track's operations are inherited form the main
     Instance that is used to install the Track. For instance, the use of
     compression per <xref target='RFC8138'/> is determined by whether it is
     used in the RPL main DODAG, e.g., by setting the "T" flag <xref target=
     'RFC9035'/> in the RPL configuration option.
   </t>
    <t>
    The Track Ingress that places a packet in a Track encapsulates it with an
    additional IPv6 header, a Routing Header, and an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header that
    contains the RPL Packet Information (RPI) as follows:
    </t>
    <ul>
    <li>
      In the uncompressed form, the source of the packet is the  address that
      this router uses as DODAGID for the Track, the destination is the first
      Via Address in the NSM-VIO, and the RH is a
      Source Routing Header (SRH) <xref target='RFC6554'/> that contains the
      list of the remaining Via Addresses, ending with the Track Egress.
    </li>
    <li>
    <t>
    The preferred alternative in a network where 6LoWPAN Header Compression
    <xref target='RFC6282'/> is used is to leverage <xref target='RFC8025'>
    "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Paging
    Dispatch"</xref> to compress the RPL artifacts as indicated in
    <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    In that case, the source routed header is the exact copy of the (chain of) SRH-6LoRH found in the NSM-VIO, also ending with the Track Egress.
    The RPI-6LoRH is appended next, followed by an IP-in-IP 6LoRH Header  that indicates the Ingress router in the Encapsulator Address field, see as a similar case Figure 20 of <xref target='RFC8138'/>.

    </t>
    </li>
    </ul>

     <t>
     To signal the Track in the packet, this specification leverages the RPL
     Forwarding model as follows:
     </t>




     <ul spacing='normal'>
     <li>
      <t>
     In the data packets, the Track DODAGID and the TrackID MUST be respectively
     signaled as the IPv6 Source Address and the RPLInstanceID field of the RPI
     that MUST be placed in the outer chain of IPv6 Headers.
      </t>
      <t>
     The RPI carries a local RPLInstanceID called the TrackID, which, in association with the DODAGID, indicates the Track along which the packet is forwarded.
      </t>
     <t>
     The D flag in the RPLInstanceID MUST be set to 0 to indicate that the source address in the IPv6 header is set to the DODAGID (more
     in <xref target='trkid'/>).
     </t>
     </li>
     <li>
      <t>
      This specification conforms to the principles of <xref target='RFC9008'/> with regards to packet forwarding and encapsulation along a Track, as follows:
      </t>

      <ul>
      <li>
      With this specification, the Track is a RPL DODAG. From the perspective of that
      DODAG, the Track Ingress is the Root, the Track Egress is a RPL-Aware
      6LR, and neighbors of the Track Egress that can be reached via the Track,
      but are external to it, are external destinations and treated as
      RPL-Unaware Leaves (RULs). The encapsulation rules in <xref target=
      'RFC9008'/> apply.
      </li><li>
      If the Track Ingress is the originator of the packet and the Track Egress
      is the destination of the packet, there is no need for an encapsulation.
      </li><li>
      So the Track Ingress must encapsulate the traffic that it did not originate,
      and it must include an RPI in the encapsulation to signal the TrackID.
      </li>
      </ul>

     <t>
     A packet that is being routed over the RPL Instance associated to a first
     Non-Storing Mode Track MAY be placed recursively in a second Track to
     cover one loose hop of the first Track as discussed in more detail <xref
     target="nssr"/>.
     On the other hand, a Storing Mode segment must be strict and a packet that
     it placed in a Storing Mode segment MUST follow that segment till the segment
     Egress.
     </t>

     </li>

    </ul>
    <t>
    It is known that a packet is forwarded along a Track by the source address
    and the RPI in the encapsulation.
    The Track ID is used to identify the RIB entries associated to that Track,
    which, in intermediate nodes, correspond to the P-routes for the segments of
    the Track that the forwarding router is aware of.
    The packet processing uses a precedence that favors self delivery or routing
    header handling when one is present, then
    delivery to direct neighbors, then to indirect neighbors, then routing
    along a segment along the Track, and finally as a last resort injecting
    the packet in another Track.
    </t><t>
    To achieve this, the packet handling logic MUST happen in the following order:
    </t>
    <ul>
     <li>
    <t>
    If the destination of the packet is self:
    </t>
    <ol>
    <li>
    if the header chain contains a
    RPL Source Route Header that is not fully consumed, then the packet is
    forwarded along the Track as prescribed by <xref target='RFC6554'/>, meaning
    that the next entry in the routing header becomes the destination;
    </li><li> otherwise:
    if the packet was encapsulated, then the packet is decapsulated and the
    forwarding process recurses; else the packet is delivered to the stack.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <!-- If the only route in the RIB was created by an NSM-VIO, this is achieved by encapsulating the packet, else by forwarding and / or delivering the packet as indicated below. -->

    </li>

    <li>
    <t>Otherwise, the packet is forwarded as follows: </t>

    <ol>
    <li>
    If the destination of the packet is a direct neighbor, e.g., installed
    by IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, then the packet MUST be
    forwarded to that neighbor;
    </li><li>
    Else If the destination of the packet is an indirect neighbor, e.g.,
    installed by a multicast DAO message from a common neighbor,
    see <xref target='extSIO'/>, then the packet MUST be forwarded to the common neighbor;
    </li><li>
    Else, if there is a RIB entry for the same Track (e.g., installed by an
    SM-VIO in a DAO message with the destination as target), and the next hop in
    the RIB entry is a direct neighbor, then the packet is passed to that neighbor;
    </li><li>
    Else, if there is a RIB entry for the different Track (e.g., installed by an
    NSM-VIO in a DAO message with the destination as target), then the packet is
    encapsulated to be forwarded along that Track and the forwarding
    process recurses; otherwise the packet is dropped.

 <!--
    </li><li>

    The longest match in the RIB indicates the next hop, and whether the route
    is installed by neighbor discovery (for direct neighbors), learned through
    an SIO in a multicast DAO message (for indirect neighbors see <xref target='extSIO'/>),
    as the target of a segment P-Route (meaning strict and Storing Mode).

    Forwarding of a packet along a track will fail if there is no such match in
    the RIB, meaning that the Track continuity is broken.
-->

    </li><li>
    To avoid loops, and as opposed to packets that were not encapsulated, a
    packet that was decapsulated from a Track MUST NOT be routed along the
    default route of the main DODAG; this would mean that the end-to-end path is
    uncontrolled. The node that discovers the fault MUST discard the packet.
    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>
    <t>
    The node that drops a packet for either of the reasons above MUST
    send an ICMPv6 Error message <xref target='RFC4443'/> to the Root,
    with a new Code "Error in P-Route" (See <xref target='ICMPv6ErrPRoute'/>).

    The Root can then repair by updating the broken segment and/or Tracks, and
    in the case of a broken segment, remove the leftover sections of the segment
    using SM-VIOs with a lifetime of 0 indicating the section to one or more
    nodes being removed (See <xref target='maintain'/>).
    </t>

    <t>In case of a permanent forwarding error along a Source Route path, the
    node that fails to forward SHOULD send an ICMP error with a code "Error
    in Source Routing Header" back to the source of the packet, as described
    in section 11.2.2.3. of <xref target='RFC6550'/>. Upon receiving this message, the
    encapsulating node SHOULD stop using the source route path for a
    reasonable period of time which depends on the deployment, and
    it SHOULD send an ICMP message with a Code "Error in P-Route" to the
    Root. Failure to follow these steps may result
    in packet loss and wasted resources along the source route path that
    is broken.
    </t>
    <t>
    Either way, the ICMP message MUST be throttled in case of consecutive
    occurrences. It MUST be sourced at the ULA or a GUA that is used in this
    Track for the source node, so the Root can establish where the error
    happened.

      </t>
      <t>

    The portion of the invoking packet that is sent back in the ICMP message
    SHOULD record at least up to the RH if one is present, and this hop of the
    RH SHOULD be consumed by this node so that the destination in
    the IPv6 header is the next hop that this node could not reach.
    If a 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH) <xref target='RFC8138'/> is used to
    carry the IPv6 routing information in the outer header then that whole
    6LoRH information SHOULD be present in the ICMP message.

   When using <xref target='RFC8138'/> in the main DODAG operated in Non-Storing
   Mode in a 6LoWPAN LLN, a typical packet that circulates in the main DODAG is
   formatted as shown in <xref target='inner'/>, representing the case where
   an IP-in-IP encapsulation is needed
   (see Table 19 of  <xref target='RFC9008'/>):

</figure>
<t>
   Since there is no page switch between the encapsulated packet and the
   encapsulation, the first octet of the compressed packet that acts as page
   selector is actually removed at encapsulation, so the inner packet used in
   the descriptions below starts with the SRH-6LoRH, and is exactly the packet
   represented in <xref target='inner'/>, from the second octet onward.
</t>

<t>When encapsulating that inner packet to place it in the Track, the first
   header that the Ingress appends at the head of the inner packet is an
   IP-in-IP 6LoRH Header; in that header, the encapsulator address, which maps to the IPv6 source address in the uncompressed form, contains a GUA or ULA IPv6 address of the Ingress node that serves as DODAG ID for the Track, expressed in the compressed form and using the DODAGID of the main DODAG as compression reference. If the address is compressed to 2 bytes, the resulting value for the Length field shown in <xref target='ipinip'/> is 3, meaning that the SRH-6LoRH as a whole is 5-octets long.

<t> At the head of the resulting sequence of bytes, the track Ingress then adds

   RPLInstanceID.
   <!-- DB: I can't make sense of this sentence, too many "as". Looks like a quick edit gone bad. -->
   Combined with the IP-in-IP 6LoRH Header, this allows to identify the Track without ambiguity.

    <section anchor="ov"><name>Less-Constrained Variations</name>
    <section anchor="smmd"><name>Storing Mode main DODAG</name>

<t>This specification expects that the main DODAG is operated in Non-Storing
   Mode. The reasons for that limitation are mostly related to LLN operations,
   power and spectrum conservation:</t>
   <ul>
   <li>In Non-Storing Mode, the Root already knowns the DODAG topology, so the
   additional topological information is reduced to the siblings.
   </li>
   <li>The downward routes are updated with unicast messages to the Root, which
   ensures that the Root can reach back to the LLN nodes after a repair faster
   than in the case of Storing Mode. Also the Root can control the use of the
   path diversity in the DODAG to reach the LLN nodes. For both reasons,
   Non-Storing Mode provides better capabilities for the Root to maintain the
   P-Routes.
   </li>
   <li>
   When the main DODAG is operated in Non-Storing Mode, P-Routes enable
   loose Source Routing, which is only an advantage in that mode. Storing Mode
   does not use Source Routing Headers, and does not derive the same benefits
   from this capability.
   <!-- DB: unclear to me what benefis and what capability are being referred to here. Can you be more explicit? -->
   </li>
   </ul>


<t>On the other hand, since RPL is a Layer-3 routing protocol, its applicability
   extends beyond LLNs to a generic IP network. RPL requires less resources
   than alternative IGPs like OSPF, ISIS, EIGRP, BABEL or RIP at the expense
   of a route stretch vs. the shortest path routes to a destination that those
   protocols compute. P-Routes add the capability to install shortest
   and/or constrained routes to special destinations such as discussed in
   section A.9.4. of the ANIMA ACP <xref target='RFC8994'/>.
</t>
<t>
   In a powered and wired network, when enough memory to store the needed
   routes is available, the RPL Storing Mode proposes a better trade-off than
   the Non-Storing, as it reduces the route stretch and lowers the load on the
   Root. In that case, the control path between the Root and the RPL nodes can
   be maintained more aggressively and with more redundancy than in LLNs,
   and the nodes can be reached to maintain the P-Routes at most times for
   a finer and more reactive control.
   </t>

<t>
   This section specifies the additions that are needed to support Projected
   Routes when the main DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   As long as the RPI can be processed adequately by the dataplane, the
   changes to this specification are limited to the DAO message.
   The Track structure, routes and forwarding operations remain the same.
   Since there is no capability negotiation, the expectation is that all the nodes in the network support this specification in the same fashion, or are configured the same way through management.
   </t>
<t>
   In Storing Mode, the Root misses the Child to Parent relationship that forms
   the main DODAG, as well as the sibling information. To provide that knowledge
   the nodes in the network MUST send additional DAO messages that are unicast
   to the Root just like Non-Storing DAO messages are.
   </t>

<t>In the DAO message, the originating router advertises a set of neighbor
   nodes using Sibling Information Options (SIO)s, regardless of the relative
   position in the DODAG of the advertised node vs. this router.
   </t>

<t>The DAO message MUST be formed as follows:
   </t>
   <ul>
   <li>
   The originating router is identified by the source address of the DAO. That
   address MUST be the one that this router registers to neighbor routers
   so the Root can correlate the DAOs from those routers when they advertise
   this router as their neighbor. The DAO contains one or more sequences of one
   Transit Information Option and one or more Sibling Information Options.
   There is no RPL Target Option so the Root is not confused into adding a
   Storing Mode route to the Target.
   </li>
   <li>
   The TIO is formed as in Storing Mode, and the Parent Address is not present.
   The Path Sequence and Path Lifetime fields
   are aligned with the values used in the Address Registration of the node(s) advertised in the SIO, as explained in Section 9.1. of
   <xref target='RFC9010'/>.
   Having similar values in all  nodes allows factorising the TIO for multiple
   SIOs as done with <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   </li>
   <!--
   <li>
   The TIO is followed by one RPL Target Option that signals the router that
   sends the information.  The Target Prefix in the RTO contains the address in
   full and the "Advertiser address in Full" (F) <xref target='RFC9010'/> flag
   is set to 1.
   </li>
   -->
   <li>The TIO is followed by one or more SIOs that provide an address (ULA or GUA) of the advertised neighbor node.
   </li>
   </ul>

<t>
   But the RPL routing information headers may not be supported on all type of
   routed network infrastructures, especially not in high-speed routers.
   When the RPI is not supported in the dataplane, there cannot be local RPL
   Instances and RPL can only operate as a single topology (the main DODAG).
   The RPL Instance is that of the main DODAG and the Ingress node that encapsulates is not the Root.
   The routes along the Tracks are alternate routes to those available along
   the main DODAG. They MAY conflict with routes to children and MUST take
   precedence in the routing table. The Targets MUST be adjacent
   to the Track Egress to avoid loops that may form if the packet is reinjected
   in the main DODAG.
  </t>
</section><!-- Storing Mode main DODAG -->

    <section anchor="bfd"><name>A Track as a Full DODAG</name>

    <t>This specification builds Tracks with parallel or interleaved protection paths as opposed
   to a more complex DODAG with interconnections at any place desirable. The
   reason for that limitation is related to constrained node operations, and the
   capability to store large amount of topological information and compute
   complex paths:</t>
   <ul>
   <li>With this specification, the node in the LLN has no topological
   awareness, and does not need to maintain dynamic information about the link
   quality and availability.
   </li>
   <li>The Root has a complete topological information and statistical metrics
   that allow it or its PCE to perform a global optimization of all Tracks in
   its DODAG. Based on that information, the Root computes the protection path and produces the source route paths.
   </li>
   <li>
   The node merely selects one of the proposed paths and applies the associated
   pre-computed routing header in the encapsulation. This alleviates both the
   complexity of computing a path and the compressed form of the routing header.
   </li>
   </ul>
   <t>The <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'>RAW Architecture</xref>
   actually expects the PLR at
   the Track Ingress to react to changes in the forwarding conditions along the
   Track, and reroute packets to maintain the required degree of reliability.
   To achieve this, the PLR needs the full richness of a DODAG to form any path
   that could meet the Service Level Objective (SLO).
   </t>
<t>
   This section specifies the additions that are needed to turn the Track
   into a full DODAG and enable the main Root to provide the necessary
   topological information to the Track Ingress. The expectation is that the
   metrics that the PLR uses are of an order other than that of the PCE,
   <!-- DB: not sure what "of an order other" means -->
   because of the difference of time scale between routing and forwarding, more
   in <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'/>. It follows that the PLR
   will learn the metrics it needs from an alternate source, e.g., OAM frames.
   </t>
<t>
   To pass the topological information to the Ingress, the Root uses a P-DAO
   messages that contains sequences of Target and Transit Information options
   that collectively represent the Track, expressed in the same fashion as in
   classical Non-Storing Mode. The difference is that the Root is the source as opposed to the destination, and can report information on many Targets, possibly the full Track, with one P-DAO.

   </t>
<t>Note that the Path Sequence and Lifetime in the TIO are selected by the Root,
   and that the Target/Transit information tuples in the P-DAO are not those
   received by the Root in the DAO messages about the said Targets. The Track
   may follow sibling routes and does not need to be congruent with the main DODAG.

    <!-- DB: the above sentence is grammatically incorrect and seems somewhat redundant with the one preceeding it.
    Was the preceeding one meant to superseede the second one? -->
    This section describes profiles that enable implementing only a portion
    of this specification to meet a particular use case.
    </t><t>
    Profiles 0 to 2 operate in the main Instance and do not require the
    support of local RPL Instances or the indication of the RPL Instance in the
    data plane. Profile 3 and above leverage Local RPL Instances to build
    arbitrary Tracks Rooted at the Track Ingress and using its namespace for
    TrackID.
    </t><t>
    Profiles 0 and 1 are REQUIRED by all implementations that may be used in
    LLNs; Profile 1 leverages Storing Mode to reduce the size of the Source
    Route Header in the most common LLN deployments. Profile 2 is RECOMMENDED
    in high speed / wired environment to enable traffic Engineering and
    network automation. All the other profile / environment combinations are
    OPTIONAL.
    </t>

    <dl>
    <dt> Profile 0 </dt><dd>
      Profile 0 is the Legacy support of <xref target='RFC6550'/> Non-Storing
      Mode, with default routing Northwards (up) and strict source routing
      Southwards (down the main DODAG). It provides the minimal common
      functionality that must be
      implemented as a prerequisite to all the Track-supporting profiles.
      The other Profiles extend Profile 0 with selected capabilities that this
      specification introduces on top.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 1 (Storing Mode P-Route segments along the main DODAG) </dt><dd>
      Profile 1 does not create new paths; compared to Profile 0, it combines
      Storing and Non-Storing Modes to balance the size of the Routing Header
      in the packet and the amount of state in the intermediate routers in a
      Non-Storing Mode RPL DODAG.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 2 (Non-Storing Mode P-Route segments along the main DODAG)</dt><dd>
      Profile 2 extends Profile 0 with Strict Source-Routing Non-Storing Mode
      P-Routes along the main DODAG, which is the same as Profile 1 but using
      NSM VIOs as opposed to SM VIOs. Profile 2 provides the same capability to
      compress the SRH in packets down the main DODAG as Profile 1, but it
      requires an encapsulation, in order to insert an additional SRH between
      the loose source routing hops.
      In that case, the Tracks MUST be installed as subTracks of the main DODAG,
      <!-- DB: not sure what "In that case," refers to. Do you mean "With Profile 2,? -->
      the main Instance MUST be used as TrackID. Note that the Ingress node
      encapsulates but is not the Root, as it does not own the DODAGID.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 3 </dt><dd>
      In order to
      form the best path possible, this Profile requires the support of
      Sibling Information Option to inform the Root of additional possible hops.
      Profile 3 extends Profile 1 with additional Storing Mode P-Routes
      that install segments that do not follow the main DODAG.
      If the segment Ingress (in the SM-VIO) is the same as the IPv6 Address of
      the Track Ingress (in the projected DAO base Object), the P-DAO creates an
      implicit Track between the segment Ingress and the segment Egress.
      </dd>
    <dt> Profile 4 </dt><dd>
      Profile 4 extends Profile 2 with Strict Source-Routing Non-Storing Mode
      P-Routes to form forward Tracks that are inside the main DODAG but do
      not necessarily follow it. A Track is formed as one or more strict source
      routed paths between the Root that is the Track Ingress, and the
      Track Egress that is the last node.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 5 </dt><dd>
      Profile 5 Combines Profile 4 with Profile 1 and enables loose source
      routing between the Ingress and the Egress of the Track. As in Profile 1,
      Storing Mode P-Routes form the connections in the loose source route.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 6 </dt><dd>
      Profile 6 Combines Profile 4 with Profile 2 and also enables loose
      source routing between the Ingress and the Egress of the Track.

    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 7 </dt><dd>
      Profile 7 implements Profile 5 in a main DODAG that is operated in
      Storing Mode as presented in <xref target='smmd'/>. As in Profile 1 and 2,
      the TrackID is the RPLInstanceID of the main DODAG. Longest match rules
      decide whether a packet is sent along the main DODAG or rerouted in a
      track.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 8 </dt><dd>
      Profile 8 is offered in preparation of the RAW work, and for use cases
      where an arbitrary node in the network can afford the same code
      complexity as the RPL Root in a traditional deployment. It offers a full
      DODAG visibility to the Track Ingress as specified in <xref target='bfd'/>
      in a Non-Storing Mode main DODAG.
    </dd>
    <dt> Profile 9 </dt><dd>
      Profile 9 combines profiles 7 and 8, operating the Track as a full DODAG
      within a Storing Mode main DODAG, using only the main DODAG RPLInstanceID

    <t>
    This specification can operate in a mixed network where some nodes support
    it and some do not. There are restrictions, though. All nodes that need to
    process a P-DAO MUST support this specification.
    As discussed in <xref target='mtsch'/>, how the root knows the
    node capabilities and whether they support this specification is out of scope.
    </t>
    <t>
    This specification defines the 'D' flag in the  RPL DODAG Configuration
    Option (see <xref target='dflag'/>) to signal that the RPL nodes can request
    the creation of Tracks. The requester may not know whether the Track can
    effectively be constructed, and whether enough nodes along the preferred
    paths support this specification. Therefore, it makes sense to only set the
    'D' flags in the DIO when the conditions of success are in place, in particular
    when all the nodes that could be on the path of tracks are upgraded.
    </t>
    </section><!-- Backwards Compatibility -->
    <section><name>Security Considerations</name>


     <t>
   It is worth noting that with <xref target='RFC6550'/>, every
   node in the LLN is RPL-aware and can inject any RPL-based attack in the
   network. This specification uses messages that are already present in RPL
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> with optional secured versions. The same secured
   versions may be used with this specification, and whatever security is deployed for
     a given network also applies to the flows in this specification.

 </t>
 <t>
	The LLN nodes depend on the RPL Root and the RANs for their operation.
	A trust model is necessary to ensure that the right devices are
	acting in these roles, avoiding sinkhole attacks (as is done in 
   <xref target='RFC7416'/> section 7). This trust model could be
   at a minimum based on a Layer-2 Secure joining and the Link-Layer security.
   This is a generic 6LoWPAN requirement, see Req5.1 in Appendix B.5 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
 </t><t>
    In a general manner, the Security Considerations in <xref target='RFC6550'/>,
    and <xref target='RFC7416'/> apply to this specification as well.
    The Link-Layer security is needed in particular to prevent
    Denial-Of-Service attacks whereby a rogue router creates a high churn in the
    RPL network by constantly injecting forged P-DAO messages and using up all
    the available storage in the attacked routers.

 </t><t>
   When applied to radio LLNs such as IEEE std 802.15.4, the lower-layer
   frame protection can be leveraged with an appropriate join protocol.
   6TiSCH defined <xref target='RFC9031'/> with the RPL Root acting as 
   6LBR.
   The join protocol could be extended to provide additional key material
   for pledge to 6LBR communication when additional end-to-end security 
   is desired beyond the hop-by-hop security from the lower layer.
 </t><t>
   With this specification, only the Root may generate P-DAO messages. PDR
   messages may only be sent to the Root. This specification expects that the
   communication with the Root is authenticated but does not enforce which method
   is used.
</t><t>
    Additionally, the trust model could include a role validation (e.g., using a
    role-based authorization) to ensure that the node that
    claims to be a RPL Root is entitled to do so. That trust should propagate
    from Egress to Ingress in the case of a Storing Mode P-DAO.

	</t><t>
    This specification suggests some validation of the VIO to prevent basic
    loops by avoiding that a node appears twice. But that is only a minimal
    protection. Arguably, an attacker that can inject P-DAOs can reroute any
    traffic and deplete critical resources such as spectrum and battery in
    the LLN rapidly.
